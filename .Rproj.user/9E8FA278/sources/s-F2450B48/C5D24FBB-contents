# UN.plot.package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of UN.plot.package is to generate any number of values from either uniform distribution or normal distribution. Plot the histogram for those values.

## Installation

You can install the released version of random.plot.package from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("tianyang1998/UN.plot.package")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to generate 100 values from normal distribution and uniform distribution. In addition, this example shows you the result histograms for these 100 values:

```{r example}
library(UN.plot.package)
## basic example code
rn <- random_normal(100)
ru <- random_unif(100)
```

The part of the result values generated from both normal distribution and uniform distribution
```{r}
head(rn$values)
head(ru$values)
```

The histograms corresponding to the result values
```{r}
rn$plot
ru$plot
```
